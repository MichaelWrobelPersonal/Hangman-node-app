#Technology Details

This is primarily a project emphasizing what can be accomplished programmatically using NodeJS.  The actual user interface is secondary in this project to the effort put into the actual gameplay..

#About the Theme

The 1st Hangman project was themed around the 2018 Sochi Winter Olympics.  It is therefore an obvious choice to theme this project after the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics.
